# Avenue
Avenue is a fictional clothes shop in the form of a web application. It also has a simple API that returns information about the shop and its products in JSON format.

## Tools Used
Avenue uses CodeIgniter 4, a PHP framework, on the backend. The frontend does not use any framework (vanilla CSS and JS). AJAX calls are used for the filtering feature on the products page.


## Features
Customers are able to view all clothes items and filter them by their category (e.g Men's clothing) and subcategory (e.g Formal wear). They can then add their selected products to their cart and pay using their wallet (an abstract version that they can load with money).

Administrators are able to add, edit and delete products as well as their categories and subcategories.

The API allows one to obtain information such as all products, categories, subcategories, all clothes purchased by a certain demographic, e.t.c.
